# Taxi-Simulation

Drivers and customers are all preset and made, the program just does basic arthimatics to pair up the customers and drivers.

After running make an executable called ``taxi`` will be made which when ran gives us an interface to work with

When a driver is printed it shows their ID, Name, Rating and Location:

Same thing applies to the customers:

The rest of the functions are straight forwards and will ask for customer/driver information and will display information based on what meets the requirements.
